# ConnectedDevices

Python scrypt for listing connected devices and their IP addresses for the Netgear Nighthawk AX12 RAX120

Super convenient but not recommended:
Set an environment variable `ROUTER_ACCESS` with the base 64 encoded `username:password` for the router to bypass the username and password prompts
